METHODS
  create_vendor
    Creates a vendor. All arguments will be passed to

    DR::SAP::Operation::Vendor::Manage::response object.

  update_vendor
    Updates a vendor. All arguments will be passed to

    "DR::SAP::Operation::Vendor::Create->new". Returns a
    DR::SAP::Operation::Vendor::Manage::response object.

  link_vendors
    Pass in two DR::SAP::Data::Vendor objects (HashRef's will be coerced
    automatically) to create a link from the first to the second (for funds
    transfers).

  add_third_party
    Pass in a DR::SAP::Data::LightweightVendor and DR::SAP::Data::ThirdParty
    (or something that can be coerced to those, like HashRefs) and this
    method will create a connection between the two of them.

  get_third_parties

  retrieve_open_items
  get_regions_by_country
    Returns a HashRef that may vary depending on the arguments passed in. If
    no arguments are passed in, it returns a HashRef keyed by country codes

    If a country is passed in, a single-level HashRef is returned mapping
    region codes to region names.

  get_region_name
    Accepts a country (code) and region (code) and returns the
    human-readable name of that region.

  get_region_code
    Accepts a country (code) and region name and returns the corresponding
    region code, assuming one exists. A case-insensitive match is performed.

  get_countries
    Returns a HashRef mapping country codes to names.

  get_country_name
    Returns a country name for the code that's passed in, if it exists

  get_country_code
    Returns a country code for the name that's passed in, if it exists

CONFIGURATION
    SOAP WSDL, endpoint, etc
        If you would like to use something other than the default endpoint
        or packaged WSDL file, you may call the following once:

                # these settings will apply to all WSDLs
                DR::SAP::WSDL::Default->initialize(
                        endpoint_host => 'some.endpoint.com',
                        port => 'HTTP' # or HTTPS
                );

                # this only applies to the individual WSDL file
                DR::SAP::WSDL::VendorMaintenance->initialize(
                        file     => '/path/to/VendorMaintenance.wsdl',
                );

    These may be set for each DR::SAP::WSDL object.
